// Create a class for a book that represents book’s

//  information such as title, author, and publication year. 

// The class should provide methods for retrieving and 

// updating the book’s details. Additionally, implement a 

// separate class for library that manages a collection of 

// books, can be an array of books as well. The library 

// class should have methods for adding books, searching 

// for books by title or author, and displaying the total 

// number of books in the library.
